        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Spicy honey lamb is an intimidating dish, but once you start cooking you'll be glad you took the challenge to make this. It was a recipe I found after a long night searching for something to eat when my local
            grocery store had a sale on bone-in lamb. So I took the change and I'm glad I did, now I"m here to share them with you.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>
            The ingredients for this recipe are seasonings you more likely than not have in your cupboard, now other ingredients you may need to go to your local store and grab before someone else does.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Bone-in lamb (or any lamb you are comfortable with pan-frying)</li>
            <li>1 tsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 chopped red pepper</li>
            <li>2 stalks chopped celery</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp paprika</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 tbsp onion powder</li>
            <li>1 tbsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp cumin</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp parsley flakes</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp basil leaves</li>
            <li>2 tsp honey</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Preheat Stovetop</strong>: Preheat stove top and set to low/low-medium and add your oil.</li>
            <li><strong>Mix seasonings in a bowl</strong>: Mix your seasonings in a bowl and set aside.</li>
            <li><strong>Rub Honey onto the lamb</strong>: Rub the honey onto the lamb, lather it nice and thick, this will help the seasonings stick better.</li>
            <li><strong>Rub seasonings onto lamb</strong>: Get your bowl of seasonings and rub it onto the lamb, make sure you rub it in nice to seal the flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook lamb</strong>: Add the lamb to the frying pan, let cook for a few minutes and flip on the other side. Cook to desired level (I prefer mine well-done).</li>
