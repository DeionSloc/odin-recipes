        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This chicken stuffing was passed down from the men and women in my family. I remember it as a coming of age to be called into the kitchen by an aunt, uncle, father, cousin
            or older sibling. They wouldn't even say a word, just gesture for you to step onto teh ladder and hand you a dish. You knew it was happening because you'd start shaking
            and your mind would be filled with questions, but you'd be too scared to ask.

            <li>1/2 tsp basil leaves</li>
            <li>(Optional) 1/4 cup of water (for consistency, but more often than not the chicken broth alone is fine)</li>
